# colour-guessing-game

A color guessing game based on the rgb color code

Note: I was not focused on browser compatability when I made this game. It turns out that it will not tell you if you guess correctly on firefox.

How to Play: You are given an rgb color code, from this code pick the color to which it corresponds.
